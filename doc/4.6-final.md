# CiviCRM v4.6.x: Publish a final release

## Pre-requisites

 * Installed+configured [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads). (Run `gcloud init`, `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ...`, or similar.)
 * Write access to all main CiviCRM GitHub repos (`civicrm-{core,packages,backdrop,drupal,joomla,wordpress}`)
 * Write access to Google Cloud Storage (`civicrm` and `civicrm-build` buckets)
 * Write access to SourceForge account (`civicrm`)
 * Import the CiviCRM GPG keypair (`7A1E75CB`)
 * Local copy of [buildkit](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit/)
 * Local clones of all main CiviCRM git repos (e.g. `mkdir src; cd src; gitify all --skip-gencode` or `cividist create dist`)

The user `releaser` on `latest.civicrm.org` has a suitable configuration in `~/src/4.6`.
To start a session, login to that account and run:

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## 1: Sanity checks

 * Note the original branch, such as `4.6`.
 * Note the intended version, such as `4.6.28` or `4.6.29`.
   * In civicrm-core.git repo, check that the code in `4.6` correctly references `4.6.X`:
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/4.6/xml/version.xml
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/4.6/sql/civicrm_generated.mysql
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/4.6/CRM/Upgrade/Incremental
   *  In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `4.6` and determine if anything should block the RC.
     * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/

## 2: Identify the final RC

Determine the identity of the final release candidate:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/4.6/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json`.

## 3: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo  (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --publish
```

## 4: Update `versions.json`

Services such as the `civicrm.org` download page and the in-app version
check depend on a file named `versions.json`. Update this.

```
## Find and examine the current list of releases.
cd /var/www/latest.civicrm.org/public/
ls -la versions.json
./bin/pb release:list

## Add the new release. Be sure to adjust versions/dates.
./bin/pb release:add 4.6.28 --date=2017-05-03 --security=false

## Make the change persistent.
git commit versions.json
git push origin master
```

## 5: Bump version

```
cd ~/src/4.6
git checkout 4.6
git pull --ff-only origin 4.6
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 4.6.Y --commit
git push origin 4.6
```
