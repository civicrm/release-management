# CiviCRM v4.6.x: Publish a final release

## Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](any-prereq.md)

## 1: Sanity checks

* Note the original branch, such as `4.6`.
* Note the intended version, such as `4.6.28` or `4.6.29`.
    * In civicrm-core.git repo, check that the code in `4.6` correctly references `4.6.X`:
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/4.6/xml/version.xml
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/4.6/sql/civicrm_generated.mysql
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/4.6/CRM/Upgrade/Incremental
    *  In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `4.6` and determine if anything should block the RC.
        * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/
    * Compare the git revisions
        * https://download.civicrm.org/latest/civicrm-46NIGHTLY-drupal.tar.gz/inspect
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/commits/4.6
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/6.x-4.6
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/7.x-4.6
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/commits/4.6
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/commits/4.6
        * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/commits/4.6
     
## 2: Identify the final RC

Determine the identity of the final release candidate:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/4.6/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json`.

## 3: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo  (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.6/civicrm-4.6.28-201705030600.json --publish
```

## 4: Update `versions.json`

Services such as the `civicrm.org` download page and the in-app version
check depend on a file named `versions.json`. Update this.

```
## Find and examine the current list of releases.
cd /var/www/latest.civicrm.org/public/
ls -la versions.json
./bin/pb release:list

## Add the new release. Be sure to adjust versions/dates.
./bin/pb release:add 4.6.28 --date=2017-05-03 --security=false

## Make the change persistent.
git commit versions.json
git push origin master
```

## 5: Bump version

```
cd ~/src/4.6
git checkout 4.6
git pull --ff-only origin 4.6
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 4.6.Y --commit
git push origin 4.6
```
