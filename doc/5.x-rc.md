# CiviCRM v5.x.0: Publish a release candidate

## Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](any-prereq.md)

## 1: Sanity checks

* Note the original branch, such as `master`.
* Note the intended version, such as `5.1` or `5.3`. (In the rest of this document, we'll refer to `5.X`, but `5.X` should be adjusted to circumstance.)
* In `civicrm-core.git` repo, check that the code in `master` correctly references `5.X.alpha1`:
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/xml/version.xml
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/sql/civicrm_generated.mysql
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/master/CRM/Upgrade/Incremental
* In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `master` and determine if anything should block the RC.
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Ext-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-E2E-Matrix/

## 2: Bump version number on `master` to `5.X.beta1`

```bash
cd ~/src/master
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only origin master
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 5.X.beta1 --commit
git push origin master
```

## 3: Make a branch

For each git repo, we want to create a new branch for 5.X. This follows a naming convention:

| repo | original branch | new branch |
|------|-----------------|------------|
|civicrm-core|master|5.X|
|civicrm-packages|master|5.X|
|civicrm-backdrop|1.x-master|1.x-5.X|
|civicrm-drupal|6.x-master|6.x-5.X|
|civicrm-drupal|7.x-master|7.x-5.X|
|civicrm-drupal-8|master|5.X|
|civicrm-joomla|master|5.X|
|civicrm-wordpress|master|5.X|

The commands `git scan branch` and `git scan push` will do this â€“ if you have a copy of each repo.

A safe way to make a clean copy of every repo is to create a new `dist` build (`civibuild create dist`). On `latest.civicrm.org`, there's already a copy in `~/src/master`. Either way, you should make sure it's up-to-date on all relevant branches -- then make new branches:

```bash
## Ensure that you have a clean, up-to-date copy of the `master` branch.
cd ~/src/master
git scan foreach -c 'pwd; git branch; echo'
git scan up
 
## Fixme: for now you need to manually add the extra drupal branches
cd drupal
git checkout 6.x-master && git pull origin 6.x-master
git checkout 8.x-master && git pull origin 8.x-master
git checkout 7.x-master && git pull origin 7.x-master
cd ..
 
## Make branches (preview)
git scan branch 5.X master -p -n -T
 
## Make branches (for real)
git scan branch 5.X master -p
 
## Push the branches (preview)
git scan push -p origin 5.X -n -T
 
## Push the branches (for real)
git scan push -p origin 5.X
```

Finally, skim the published branches to make sure they match up:

```
civi-git-table --fetch master 5.X
```

## 4: Setup automated processes

* Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/configure
    * In the list of `CIVIVER`s, remove any old RC's. Add the current RC. (ex: `4.6 5.X master`)
* Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Ext-Matrix/configure
    * In the list of `CIVIVER`s, remove any old RC's. Add the current RC. (ex: `4.6 5.X master`)
* Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-E2E-Matrix/configure
    * In the list of `CIVIVER`s, remove any old RC's. Add the current RC. (ex: `4.6 5.X master`)
* Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Publish-Schedule/configure
    * In the list of `branchNames`, remove any old RC's. Add the current RC. (ex: `master 4.6 5.X`)
   
## 5: Publish tarballs

* Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Publish/
* Check to see if the new branch is being built automatically. If not:
    * Login (if you haven't already)
    * Click "Build with parameters"
    * For the branch name, enter your chosen `5.X`.

## 6: Bump version number on `master` to  `5.Y.alpha1`

The original branch, "master", should continue development with the next version, e.g. "5.Y".

```bash
cd ~/src/master
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only origin master
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 5.Y.alpha1 --commit
git push origin master
```
