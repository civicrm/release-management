# CiviCRM v4.7.x: Publish a release candidate

## Pre-requisites

 * Write access to all main CiviCRM git repos (civicrm-{core,packages,backdrop,drupal,joomla,wordpress})
 * Access to CiviCRM Jenkins (https://test.civicrm.org)

The user `releaser` on `latest.civicrm.org` has a suitable configuration in `~/src/4.7`.
To start a session, login to that account and run:

```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## 1: Sanity checks

 * Note the original branch, such as `master`.
 * Note the intended version, such as `4.7.8` or `4.7.9`. (In the rest of this document, we'll refer to `4.7.X`, but `4.7.X` should be adjusted to circumstance.)
   * In civicrm-core.git repo, check that the code in `master` correctly references `4.7.X`:
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/xml/version.xml
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/blob/master/sql/civicrm_generated.mysql
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/master/CRM/Upgrade/Incremental
   *  In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `master` and determine if anything should block the RC.
     * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/

## 2: Make a branch

For each git repo, we want to create a new branch for the RC. This follows a naming convention:


| repo | original branch | new branch |
|------|-----------------|------------|
|civicrm-core|master|4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-packages|master|4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-backdrop|1.x-master|1.x-4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-drupal|6.x-master|6.x-4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-drupal|7.x-master|7.x-4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-drupal|8.x-master|8.x-4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-joomla|master|4.7.X-rc|
|civicrm-wordpress|master|4.7.X-rc|

The commands `git scan branch` and `git scan push` will do this â€“ if you have a copy of each repo.

A safe way to make a clean copy of every repo is to create a new `dist` build (`civibuild create dist`). On `latest.civicrm.org`, there's already a copy in `~/src/4.7`. Either way, you should make sure it's up-to-date on all relevant branches -- then make new branches:

```bash
## Clone all the repos. Ensure that you have a clean, up-to-date copy of the `master` branch.
cd ~/src/4.7
git scan foreach -c 'pwd; git branch; echo'
git scan status
 
## Fixme: for now you need to manually add the extra drupal branches
cd drupal
git checkout 6.x-master && git pull origin 6.x-master
git checkout 8.x-master && git pull origin 8.x-master
git checkout 7.x-master && git pull origin 7.x-master
cd ..
 
## Make branches (preview)
git scan branch 4.7.X-rc master -p -n -T
 
## Make branches (for real)
git scan branch 4.7.X-rc master -p
 
## Push the branches (preview)
git scan push -p origin 4.7.X-rc -n -T
 
## Push the branches (for real)
git scan push -p origin 4.7.X-rc
```

You might want to spot-check a few URLs to ensure the branches were published, e.g.

 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/tree/1.x-4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/6.x-4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/7.x-4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/8.x-4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/tree/4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/tree/4.7.X-rc
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/tree/4.7.X-rc

## 3: Setup automated tests

 * Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/configure
 * In the list of `CIVIVER`s, remove any old RC's. Add the current RC.

## 4: Publish tarballs

 * Go to https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Publish/
 * Check to see if the new branch is being built automatically. If not:
   * Login (if you haven't already)
   * Click "Build with parameters"
   * For the branch name, enter your chosen `4.7.X-rc`.

## 5: Bump version number on `master` to  `4.7.Y`

The original branch, "master", should continue development with the next version, e.g. "4.7.Y".

```bash
cd ~/src/4.7
git checkout master
git pull --ff-only origin master
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 4.7.Y --commit
git push origin master
```
