# CiviCRM v4.7.x: Publish a final release

## Pre-requisites

 * Installed+configured [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads). (Run `gcloud init`, `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ...`, or similar.)
 * Write access to all main CiviCRM GitHub repos (`civicrm-{core,packages,backdrop,drupal,joomla,wordpress}`)
 * Write access to Google Cloud Storage (`civicrm` and `civicrm-build` buckets)
 * Write access to SourceForge account (`civicrm`)
 * Import the CiviCRM GPG keypair (`7A1E75CB`)
 * Local copy of [buildkit](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit/)
 * Local clones of all main CiviCRM git repos (e.g. `mkdir src; cd src; gitify all --skip-gencode` or `cividist create dist`)

The user `releaser` on `latest.civicrm.org` has a suitable configuration in `~/src/4.7`.

## 1: Identify the final RC

Determine the identity of the final release candidate:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/*rc/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json`.

## 2: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd /path/to/civicrm

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --publish
```

## 3: Set default on `civicrm.org` (WIP)

... login to `latest` and update versions.json ...

## 4: Set default on `sourceforge.net`

Log into https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable and set the latest Drupal version to be the default download.

Eg: After 4.6.8 release, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable/4.6.8/  . Click on "i" for `civicrm-4.6.8-drupal.tar.gz`, then select all "Default Download For" and "Save".

Note that it takes some time to reflect default download on `sf.net`
