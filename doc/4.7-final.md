# CiviCRM v4.7.x: Publish a final release

#  <span style="color:red">__WARNING__: Not updated since 5.x</span>


## Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](any-prereq.md)

## 1: Sanity checks

 * Check release notes: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/4.7.X-rc/release-notes
 * In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `4.7.X-rc` and determine if anything should block the release.
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Ext-Matrix/
 * Compare the git revisions
     * https://download.civicrm.org/latest/civicrm-RC-drupal.tar.gz/inspect
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/commits/4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/commits/1.x-4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/6.x-4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/7.x-4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/commits/4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/commits/4.7.X-rc
     * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/commits/4.7.X-rc

## 2: Identify the final RC

Determine the identity of the final release candidate:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/*rc/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json`.

## 3: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd ~/src/4.7
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd ~/src/4.7

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/4.7.19-rc/civicrm-4.7.19-201705030600.json --publish
```

You might want to spot-check a few URLs to ensure the tags were published, e.g.

 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/tree/1.x-4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/6.x-4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/7.x-4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/8.x-4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/tree/4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/tree/4.7.X
 * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/tree/4.7.X

## 4: Update `versions.json`

Services such as the `civicrm.org` download page and the in-app version
check depend on a file named `versions.json`. Update this.

```
## Find and examine the current list of releases.
cd /var/www/latest.civicrm.org/public/
ls -la versions.json
./bin/pb release:list

## Add the new release. Be sure to adjust versions/dates.
./bin/pb release:add 4.7.19 --date=2017-05-03 --security=false

## Make the change persistent.
git commit versions.json
git push origin master
```

## 5: Set default on `sourceforge.net`

Log into https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable and set the latest Drupal version to be the default download.

Eg: After 4.6.8 release, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable/4.6.8/  . Click on "i" for `civicrm-4.6.8-drupal.tar.gz`, then select all "Default Download For" and "Save".

Note that it takes some time to reflect default download on `sf.net`
