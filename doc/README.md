## CiviCRM Release Mechanics

 * CiviCRM v4.6.x
   * [Publish a final release](4.6-final.md)
   * [Announce a final release](any-announce.md)
 * CiviCRM v4.7.x
   * [Publish a release candidate](4.7-rc.md)
   * [Evaluate a release candidate](4.7-rc-eval.md)
   * [Publish a final release](4.7-final.md)
   * [Announce a final release](any-announce.md)

> The 4.6 process differs from the 4.7 process:
>  a. At a policy level, 4.6 does not use release candidates. 4.7 does.
>  b. At a technical level, 4.6 does not provide as many build-artifacts
>     as 4.7. (Notably, 4.7 includes the JSON-git report and the Backdrop build).
