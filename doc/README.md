## CiviCRM Release Mechanics

 * CiviCRM v4.6.x
   * [Publish a final release](4.6-final.md)
   * [Announce a final release](any-announce.md)
 * CiviCRM v4.7.x
   * [Publish a release candidate](4.7-rc.md)
   * [Evaluate a release candidate](4.7-rc-eval.md)
   * [Publish a final release](4.7-final.md)
   * [Announce a final release](any-announce.md)

> __Note__: 4.6 and 4.7 have slightly different release policies: 4.7 uses release-candidates, and 4.6 does not. This leads to slightly different steps for each.
