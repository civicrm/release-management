# CiviCRM v5.x.0: Publish a stable release

## Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](any-prereq.md)

## 1: Set the final version to `5.X.0`

```bash
cd ~/src/master
git checkout 5.X
git pull --ff-only origin 5.X
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 5.X.0 --commit
git push origin 5.X
```

## 2: Sanity checks

* Check open PRs for `5.X`: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pulls
* Check regressions/criticals in Gitlab:
    * https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues?label_name[]=regression
    * https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues?label_name[]=priority%3Acritical
* Check release notes: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/5.X/release-notes
* In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `5.X` and determine if anything should block the release.
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Ext-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-E2E-Matrix/
* In Jenkins, ensure that the final tarballs have been prepared. Run the job manually if you're impatient.
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Publish/
* Compare the git revisions
    * https://download.civicrm.org/latest/branch/5.X/LATEST/civicrm-X.Y.Z-drupal-LATEST.tar.gz/inspect

## 3: Prepare and identify the final tarballs

After running, determine the identity of the final build:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/5.2/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json`.

## 4: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd ~/src/master
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd ~/src/master

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.0-201705030600.json --publish
```

You might want to spot-check a few URLs to ensure the tags were published, e.g.

* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/tree/1.x-5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/6.x-5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/7.x-5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal-8/tree/5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/tree/5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/tree/5.X.0
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/tree/5.X.0

## 5: Update `versions.json`

Services such as the `civicrm.org` download page and the in-app version
check depend on a file named `versions.json`. Update this.

```
## Find and examine the current list of branches.
cd /var/www/latest.civicrm.org/public/
ls -la versions.json
./bin/pb branch:list

## Add the new branch. Be sure to adjust versions.
./bin/pb branch:status 5.2 stable

## Add the new release. Be sure to adjust versions/dates.
./bin/pb release:add 5.2.0 --date=2018-05-03 --security=false

## If appropriate, set the deprecation and eol dates for the previous
## version.
./bin/pb branch:status 5.1 -D 2018-06-10 -E 2018-06-15
```

Preview the upgrade messages that will be displayed on various versions.
This example previews the perspective from 5.0.2 and 5.8.0 (adjust to taste):

http://latest.civicrm.org/stable.php?format=devPreview&versions=5.0.2,5.8.0

Finally:

```
## Make the change persistent.
git commit versions.json
git push origin master
```

## 6: Make new versions visible on download sites

Log into https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable and set the latest Drupal version to be the default download.

Eg: After 4.6.8 release, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable/4.6.8/  . Click on "i" for `civicrm-4.6.8-drupal.tar.gz`, then select all "Default Download For" and "Save".

Note that it takes some time to reflect default download on `sf.net`

Log into https://civicrm.org/user and clear the page-cache in https://civicrm.org/admin/config/development/performance
