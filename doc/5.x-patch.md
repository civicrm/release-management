# CiviCRM v5.x.x: Publish a patch release

## Prerequisites

See [Prerequisites](any-prereq.md)

## 1: (If you haven't already) Set the final version to `5.X.Y`

```bash
cd ~/src/master
git checkout 5.X
git pull --ff-only origin 5.X
./tools/bin/scripts/set-version.php 5.X.Y --commit
git push origin 5.X
```

## 2: (If you haven't already) Backport patches to `5.X` branch

e.g.

```bash
cd ~/src/master
git checkout 5.X
git cherry-pick abcd1234abcd1234 
git push origin 5.X
```

## 3: Sanity checks

* Check release notes: https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/5.X/release-notes
* In Jenkins, review the scheduled tests for `5.X` and determine if anything should block the release.
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Core-Matrix/
    * https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Ext-Matrix/
* Compare the git revisions
    * https://download.civicrm.org/latest/civicrm-RC-drupal.tar.gz/inspect
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/commits/5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/commits/1.x-5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/6.x-5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/commits/7.x-5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/commits/5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/commits/5.X
    * https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/commits/5.X

## 4: Prepare and identify the final tarballs

In Jenkins, ensure that the final tarballs have been prepared. Run the job manually if you're impatient.

* https://test.civicrm.org/job/CiviCRM-Publish/

After running, determine the identity of the final build:

```
gsutil ls gs://civicrm-build/5.2/*json
```

For example, we might pick `gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json`.

## 5: Publish

You can do the full process in one command:

```
cd ~/src/master
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --get --sign --tag --publish
```

or do the steps individually:

```
cd ~/src/master

## Download and rename the RC tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --get

## Generate signatures for tarballs
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --sign

## Generate tags in each repo (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --tag -n

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (dry run)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --publish -n

## Generate tags in each repo (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --tag -f

## Publish tarballs to Sourceforge and Gcloud (really)
releaser gs://civicrm-build/5.2/civicrm-5.2.1-201705030600.json --publish
```

You might want to spot-check a few URLs to ensure the tags were published, e.g.

* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-backdrop/tree/1.x-5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/6.x-5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/7.x-5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-drupal/tree/8.x-5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-joomla/tree/5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/tree/5.X.1
* https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-wordpress/tree/5.X.1

## 6: Update `versions.json`

Services such as the `civicrm.org` download page and the in-app version
check depend on a file named `versions.json`. Update this.

```
## Find and examine the current list of releases.
cd /var/www/latest.civicrm.org/public/
ls -la versions.json
./bin/pb release:list

## Add the new release. Be sure to adjust versions/dates.
./bin/pb release:add 5.2.1 --date=2018-05-03 --security=false

## Make the change persistent.
git commit versions.json
git push origin master
```

## 7: Set default on `sourceforge.net`

Log into https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable and set the latest Drupal version to be the default download.

Eg: After 4.6.8 release, go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/civicrm/files/civicrm-stable/4.6.8/  . Click on "i" for `civicrm-4.6.8-drupal.tar.gz`, then select all "Default Download For" and "Save".

Note that it takes some time to reflect default download on `sf.net`
