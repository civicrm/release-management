# CiviCRM Release Management

This project supports meta-activities for release-management, such as the
index of release-plans and the release invitations.

## Philosophy

Reviewing and testing are natural, important, on-going parts of software-development, but they generally cannot be done by the original developer. All developers have a shared interest in having their changes reviewed by a neutral and competent party. The goal of the release-cycle is to match-up developers who are willing to check each other's work, and to bring in feedback from non-developers to improve quality assurance.
