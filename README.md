 * **Invitations**: The release-manager curates the list of pending PRs and invites developers to partner-up based on related topics (such as a "CiviMail" group or a "CiviContribute" group). All members of the core developer team will participate.
 * **Review Week**: Participants review each other's PRs. This may involve some discussion, code-review, testing, merging, or closing PRs.
 * **Test Week**: Participants install the release-candidate with realistic configurations (eg staging sites) and check that their major customizations still work. Emergency issues (regressions) may be fixed.

(Note: This is a new process and may change for future releases.)

## Philosophy

Reviewing and testing are natural, important, on-going parts of software-development, but they generally cannot be done by the original developer. All developers have a shared interest in having their changes reviewed by a neutral and competent party. The goal of the release-cycle is to match-up developers who are willing to check each other's work, and to bring in feedback from non-developers to improve quality assurance.
